    <p>This photo was at <a href="https://www.sealbeachca.gov/About-Seal-Beach" target="_blank">Seal Beach</a>, CA on February 13th, 2024. Seal Beach is located in Orange County, CA. It's one of my favorite beaches because of it's lively, but small Main Street with so many hidden gems. I was filming at this location for my short film and saw this beautiful sunset!</p>

    <p>This photo was at <a href="https://www.huntingtonbeachca.gov/departments/parks_recreation/beach_information/index.php" target="_blank">Huntington Beach</a>, CA on July 8th, 2024. I was at a club bonding event. It might not have been the best day to go to the beach because it was so cloudy, but right at sunset we got this beautiful view for 15 minutes! I love Huntington Beach because of Pacific City, a beautiful outdoors-mall located directly in front of the beach. </p>
