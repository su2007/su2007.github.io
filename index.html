    <p>This photo was taken at <a href="https://www.sealbeachca.gov/About-Seal-Beach" target="_blank">Seal Beach</a>, CA on February 13th, 2024. Seal Beach is located in Orange County, CA. It's one of my favorite beaches because of it's lively, but small Main Street with so many hidden gems. I was filming at this location for my short film and saw this beautiful sunset!</p>

    <p>This photo was taken at <a href="https://www.huntingtonbeachca.gov/departments/parks_recreation/beach_information/index.php" target="_blank">Huntington Beach</a>, CA on July 8th, 2024. I was at a club bonding event. It might not have been the best day to go to the beach because it was so cloudy, but right at sunset we got this beautiful view for 15 minutes! I love Huntington Beach because of Pacific City, a beautiful outdoors-mall located directly in front of the beach. </p>

    <p>This photo was taken at Huntington Beach, CA on August 3rd, 2024. This was during senior sunrise and it was 7:00 am, but I was crazy enough to go into the freezing water. I stayed at the beach that from 5am to 12pmâ€”and I didn't get any sleep the night before.</p>

    <p>This photo was taken at Huntington Beach, CA on May 29th, 2024. This was during the end of the year class bonfire event. It was a beautiful sunny day, but the water was so dirty so I did not go in...However, somehow, my pants still got wet and sandy so I had to buy new pants at Pacific City. </p>
